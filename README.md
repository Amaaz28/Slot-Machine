Slot Machine Game ðŸŽ°

A simple, interactive slot machine game built in Python. This project showcases fundamental programming concepts, including loops, conditionals, functions, and user input validation. It provides an engaging way for users to test their luck and practice responsible betting, all while learning core Python skills.
Features

    Customizable Betting System: Users can choose the number of lines to bet on and set their bet amount per line, with limits enforced for responsible gameplay.
    Symbol-Based Slot Machine: The game uses a randomization algorithm to generate outcomes with varying probabilities for different symbols, ensuring fair play.
    Winning Calculations: Winnings are calculated based on matched symbols and their respective values, with winnings displayed after each spin.
    Balance Tracking: Users' balance is updated in real-time, and the game only allows bets that the user can afford.

How It Works

    Deposit Funds: Players start by depositing money to set their initial balance.
    Place Bets: Choose the number of lines to bet on (up to 3) and the amount to wager per line.
    Spin the Slots: The game generates random symbols for each column and checks for winning lines.
    Payouts: Winnings are calculated and added to the balance, or losses are deducted. The player can continue playing or quit the game.

Symbol Values and Probabilities

The game uses a weighted probability system for symbol appearances:

    Symbol A: Appears 2 times, Value: 5
    Symbol B: Appears 4 times, Value: 4
    Symbol C: Appears 6 times, Value: 3
    Symbol D: Appears 8 times, Value: 2
